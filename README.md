## Description

The purpose of this application was to refactor a book search engine's code to replace restful apis with the Graphql api. Refactoring this code meant using the Apollo server to help express.js take in the resolvers and schemas. It also meant refactoring the authentication, along with multiple react components to take in those mutations and queries.

## Usage

To use the application, you can start by looking for any book or topic in the search bar. From there, up to 10 books should show up regarding that topic. However, you will not be able to add those books to your saved book collection without first signing up for an account on the top right of the corner. After you signup, you should be automatically logged in and the page should refresh. From there, whenever you search for the books, you will see a blue button that says "Save this Book!" under each book. Once you successfully save it, the button should say "This book has already been saved!". To view your saved books, simply go to the See your books section on the top right. From there you will see all the books you saved earlier. To delete the books from your collection, simply press on the Delete button on the card of the book you want to remove from your collection.
